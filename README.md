I'd like to point out that I've only spent a total of around 4 hours on this and that Ruby hasn't been my primary language for a year.
Things may not be as clean as they should be but I'll be going through each of my "smells" and doubts later on.

## Why did I do it the way I did?

While in the rush of writing all of this code, I've been relying on my instincts on asking myself the right questions and knowing whether I should spend more time refactoring or move on.

## How can I improve this?

  - Allocate much more time to this test.
  - Clean up repeated error messages.
  - Reduce the amount of casting I'm doing to variables.
  - Returning with a string instead of putting would've made this easier to unit test.
  - Spec style unit tests might've actually reduced the amount of lines of code I've written.
